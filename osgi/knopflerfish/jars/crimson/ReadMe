This bundle has been modified from the knopflerfish original so that I
can turn off bootdelegation.  The problem is that various bundles
(e.g. the equinox registry) do xml parsing.  This jar sets up a class
from the crimson parser as  the xml parser to use.  If the other
bundles can't load this class (they don't have it on their imports
list) then their parse will fail.

There may be another way to get this to work but what I have done is
to 

   1. remove the crimson.jar from this bundle.
   2. add the removed crimson.jar to the system classpath
   3. added a boot delegation item for org.apache.crimson.jaxp
   4. removed all the exports from this bundle.

Items 1, 2 and 3 allow any bundle to do xml parsing.  Item 4 prevents
the problem that bundles will import org.w3c.dom from this bundle but
this bundle no longer has them to export (because of item 2).
